# The Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a program through text commands.
# The thing you see in the terminal is a CLI.

# Configure the generative AI library with your personal API key

# This key allows access to Google's generative AI services. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key.

# Here, we use the 'gemini-1.5-flash' model, which is a fast and conversational AI model
